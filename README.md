# Qwirk #

Currently there isn't much to run. Eventually there will be three primary components: a game engine, a route engine, and a game client. 

For now there's just a small part of a game engine. This is a python3 application. Just start main.py. 

I'm building version "alpha", which is 0.0.1. Really just aiming for MVP at this point. 

The goal of Qwirk is to be similar to RoboRally, a Wizards of the Coast game I played when I was a kid. The basic idea is that you and a few other "robots" are in a factory trying to reach several objectives. Unlike other games, you must define your actions in small sets before they can be carried out (like programming). Unexpected changes in the board or other character's actions may interfere with your own causing trouble during the execution of your program. Fun times.
